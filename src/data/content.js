      message: "Welcome to Al-Madani Girls School. Our school has been running since September 2018, having been set up by the Abu Haneefa Trust. The school covers Key Stage 3 & 4 education (Ages 11-16). As a Grammar school, it is selective in its intake. As an Independent school, it is fee based.\n\nThe school runs five Year groups with a maximum of 24 children per group, so the maximum school size is 120 pupils. Each year group learns a broad academic syllabus. Our school aims to equip your daughter with essential knowledge for life that will enable her to gain mastery in her academic, personal, and social spheres as well as spiritual success in the dunya and akhirah.\n\nThe underpinning ethos of our curriculum at Al-Madani Girls School embraces everything that your daughter does. When all is said and done, a girl does not come to Al-Madani Girls School simply to earn a set of qualifications. That is obviously an important part of what happens in the school, and we take the attainment of the best set of qualifications that each of our girls is capable of achieving very seriously, but it is certainly true that some of the most important things that one learns at school are not really to be measured in terms of qualifications.\n\nPositive habits formed at the beginning of her school career will be crucial in her success. When your daughter leaves Al-Madani Girls School, she will have several years experience of academic, sporting, and perhaps most importantly, personal growth to look back on, the greater part of the latter having been centred on her year group and the friendships she has made there.\n\nShe will almost certainly go on to university or other career progression tracks that she so chooses.\n\nLife at Al-Madani Girls School is rich, varied, exciting, challenging, sometimes even exhausting, but, above all, with the grace, help and Tawfeeq of Almighty Allaah, enormously rewarding. It is our aim to offer your daughter such opportunities that will transform her into a fine upstanding young lady capable of making substantive contributions to her family, community, society and country.\n\nThe Al-Madani Girls School girl of today is a global citizen and leader of tomorrow, in-shaa-Allaah.\n\nYet, the most important figures and influence in her life will be her parents, her home circle and wider community. We at school cannot truly educate your daughter without your help, so we look forward to your fully supportive and cooperative partnership with us. Your contribution will be the indispensable basis and a key component of the student, parents and educators relationship that will effectively contribute to outstanding morals, outstanding behaviour and outstanding educational experiences and achievements, in-shaa-Allah.",
